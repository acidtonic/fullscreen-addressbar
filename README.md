I did not author this work, I downloaded the plugin located below....
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullscreen-address-bar/ppmkmdianhgppfjciekeiodmgdppglno?hl=en

It was very useful in displaying the URL bar when in fullscreen but it also added a menu showing a 
tab switcher that used control. This meant any hotkey with control was ruined such as copy/paste or select all..

I edited the code to use the ALT key rather than the CONTROL key so the functionality to switch tabs remains....
It's as simple as editing line 63 of js/fullScreener.js with the proper ascii code.

For key combinations a more in-depth edit would be required and is not supported.

To install, open extensions in developer mode and use install unpacked extension on this projects folder.

Again, I did not write this. I do not claim credit in any way.
